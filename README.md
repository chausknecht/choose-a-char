== Choose a Char

You are a game master tired of creating new NSCs?
Or you are a game developer searching for the ultimate race or item?
Or you simply are a player who needs inspiration for your next character?

*Choose a Char* is at your hands! Let an algorithm create the content you need and pick your favorite character within a simple but powerful interface.

== Mission

This project is simply a *toy* application for testing out the awsomeness of the new [fritz2](https://www.fritz2.dev/) web application framework.
Therefor neither the use case nor the UI are designed with any benfit for the user in mind. On the contrary this *artificial* workflow is only motivated by experimenting with some core features of fritz2:

- Components
- Stores & State Management
- dynamic content and attributes
- dynamic behaviour based upon UI state
- flows as asyncronous data sources

Eventually I will show some excerpts of the code as examples for common patterns and also unusual or even smells within the design, as I gradually dive deeper into the framework.
